# AI_pdf_summarizer

# üìù Introduction
In today's fast-paced world, reading through lengthy documents can be time-consuming. The AI PDF Summarizer is designed to make this process easier by extracting key information from PDFs and generating a concise, AI-powered summary.
How does it work?
- Uploads a PDF (supports files with text only).
- Extracts only the text (ignores images without OCR).
- Uses LangChain with Mistral-8x7B via groq api.
- Incorporated CoT (Chain of thought) prompting to generate the summary.
- Allows users to choose summary **length & format**.
- Presents the summary in an easy-to-read format through the Gradio web interface.
- This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible without installation.
